# UTest_Example
An example project for unit testing embedded systems. You can use this project as a template for establishing unit testing for your project.

## Folders
* **Sources** - Source files for the unit test examples.
* **TestingUtils** - Utilities for unit tests, such as Catch2 and FFF headers.
* **UTest** - A folder for unit test build scripts.

## Building

### Prerequisites
* C and C++ compiler
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) - CMake for generating the build environment.

The easiest way to setup the environment is to use Linux or [Linux sub-system in Windows 10](https://www.windowscentral.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-windows-10). In Linux all you need is to install build-essential package and CMake.

### Building
Run  `./build.sh` in UTest directory.
